ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jess! 


**Work.** The future is full of opportunities, so I devise ways to build software in order to impact people's lives in a meaningful way as a technical leader.  Throughout my career, I have had the privilege to lead a breadth of individual contributors and people managers.  I take pride in my ability to zoom-out to strategize from a macro lens (technological roadmap, human collaboration) while also zooming-in depth to understand peopleâ€™s motivations and the intricate details of the software implementation and systems architecture.  I constantly strive do meaningful work in environments where people feel safe to explore, fail, and learn.  

I have applied my expertise in: _internet-scale platforms, e-commerce, public transportation services, and financial systems._

My areas of interest include: _natural language processing, machine learning, distributed systems, DevOps, cloud computing, culture, intersectionality and egalitarianism._

**Free Time.** I enjoy storytelling, cooking, producing music, traveling, and being physically active.  Continuous growth and learning is an integral part of my personal values.

**Thoughtlot.**  I started this site to improve my writing, a place to store and organize my trails of thoughts, rants and ramblings.  Words are my own, as are my views.
