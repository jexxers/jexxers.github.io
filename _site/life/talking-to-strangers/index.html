    <p>From the first time I spotted “The Tipping Point” in a bookstore, I was hooked on Malcolm Gladwell’s analyses of social phenonenoms.  Although it has been difficult for me to keep up with my expectations of my own reading habits, I found myself pleasantly to put on an audiobook for the first time.  After browsing, what seemed like endless period of time, on Toronto Public Library’s website - I came across Gladwell’s latest book, Talking to Strangers.  It was a fun binge, would do again.</p>

<p>Gladwell, as many good narrative non-fiction writers will do, illustrates key points (albeit sometimes repetitively) they want one to take away, with stories that backup their position and claims.</p>

<p>The book centers around the idea of: truth-default theory, transparency, and coupling.  Truth-default theory states that the average humans naively defaults-to-truth, unless given sufficient evidence otherwise.  Transparency is the idea that “the way a stranger looks and acts is a reliable clue to the way they feel”.  Coupling is the idea that our behaviours are highly more influenced by our environmental factors.  Gladwell shares stories to evaluate both sides of these pheonenoms.</p>

<p>The book starts with a series of puzzles including Sandra Bland who has an encounter with a police officer.  The officer ends up arresting her for failing to signal, and Sandra is found dead a few days later in her jail cell.  Before we go deeper in her story, Gladwell segways into the first encounter between Cortez and Montezuma, where cultural differences get lost in translation.  Montezuma expresses humility in stating that him is small and weak, while Cortez pumps up his strength.  In the end, poor Montezuma, and the Aztecs lose their land and lives to their invaders.  Fast forward to WWII, Neville Chamberlain is determined to meet Adolf Hitler to de-escalate the tension around a rising Germany.  Chamberlain is convinced that Hitler has no ambitions beyond a few disputed territories around Germany, while history remembers Chamberlain as a fool who trusted a war-monger.  In both of these encounters, one party failed to judge the true intent of their adversaries.  Gladwell argues that Chamberlain could have understood the mind of Hitler better had he stayed home and read Mein Kampf.  Similarly, Gladwell finds a study where a machine learning algorithm outperformed human judges when it came to parole hearings<sub>2</sub>.  He argues that more we get to know someone, the more we may be mislead or deceived, especially when that person has incentives to do so.  This reminds me of the story of Michael LaPaglia<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Now that we have introduced our mystery, Gladwell tells the story of Ana Montes, one of the most damaging spies in American history.  Ana Montes spend 15 years leaking secrets to the Cuban government, and was investigated by counter-intelligence agents, yet due to her reputation, combined with her benign excuses, let her escape from arrest for many years.  Defaulting to truth, means that we overlook sometimes mounting evidence until triggers us to force us to evaluate more clearly.  Jerry Sandusky was a well-respected football coach, and seemingly generous and charitable person.  However almost a decade lapsed from the night he was sighted sexually abusing a young boy, before he was arrested.  To add to the confusion, many of his victims looked to him as a father figure, and their testimonies were sometimes buried under layers of trauma.  Gladwell makes the point that many people assume there’s a larger conspiracy at play such as the school administration trying to cover up, or for some monetary gain, but he argues that humans tend to want to believe the best in people.  Especially when those people tell you their version of the truth.  The next segment talks about Larry Nassar, whom sexually abused young women, sometimes in front of their parents.  His cover-up story says that it was part of his medical procedures.  It took almost a decade and hundreds of victims before enough evidence mounted to prosecuting him.  In this case, the people involved were parents of the victims who could not fathom such attrocities were happening to their own children.  I must say, this book is probably the heaviest of the materials that Gladwell has written.</p>

<p>As far as Ponzi scheme goes, Bernie Madoff holds the record for the largest at tens of billions of American dollars.  Gladwell’s focus on the events is less about Madoff, but more about Harry Markopolos.  Markopolos is a whistleblower whom is suspect of everyone.  Gladwell follows Markopolos’ attempts to rally support, but was repeatedly ignored.  After hearing audio excerpts, one can easily imagine Markopolos as the caricature of a man wearing a tinfoil hat.  Markpolos had a reputation for distruting everyone.  The lesson about Markopolos is that good faith and trust forms the basis of our society, which fosters and encourage human co-operation<sub>1</sub>.  If we all acted like Markopolos, we may be risk-averse, and as in finance, gain less in the end.</p>

<p>Gladwell has a small segment where he brings in how facial gestures are measured in laboratory settings, as well as how they can be applied in the TV show, Friends.  He makes an argument that in acting, the point is to clearly convey the emotions usually in a dramatised way to the audience.  Real life does not act this way, yet we often assume we can read people’s intentions based on their body language.  In the trial of Amanda Knox, the young American woman who was accused of mudering her Italian roommate, she was judged harshly as she did not act in a way others expected her to.  This judgement lead her prosecutors to misjudge her character, simply as they did not understand her as she did not fit a preconceive mold of how one should act upon finding their roommate murdered.  This is transparency.</p>

<p>KSM?</p>

<p>The rape case of Brock Turner was discussed in Talking to Strangers.  While nonetheless Brock Turner is guilty for his crimes, Gladwell examines in the impact of alcohol on campuses.  Talking to strangers is hard enough - throw in courtship, heavy binge drinking rituals (“<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pregaming">pre-gaming</a>”), unstructured social norms, and you get impossible situations.  In my opinion, of course, we would be ingrained in consent culture, and it is something we should strive for, but in the team time…  Gladwell points to how the brain’s memories and functions are impacted by alcohol.  Particularly, our memories can be misleading and outright shut down while people can seemingly demonstrate the ability to carry out tasks.  Through surveys, college students have expressed that they would rather combat sexual assult by teaching men to respect women, as well as women learning self defence, than to curb the amount of drinking at a party.</p>

<p>Sylvia Plath’s death introduces the idea of coupling.  Sylvia Plath took her own life via carbon monoxide poisoning, by sticking her head into an oven.  This was only possible during the “town gas years”, before the push for natural gas.  Gladwell examines how this method of suicide was incredibly popular during those years, and could see higher suicide rates during those years.  With regards to suicide, the idea goes that, if someone was to end their life, they would be so determined to do it, no matter what methods were made available to them.  Gladwell argues that idea is false, and the mechanism of which one took their life, matters a lot.  That is, Sylvia Plath’s decision to take her life is coupled to the fact carbon-monoxide poisoning was so accessible.</p>

<p>This brings us to the raising crime in America.  In Boston, a criminologist notices that while crime is concentrated on a few blocks within a city.  This analysis is carried out throughout America and the world, and holds true.  The criminologist argues that the most effective method of patrol, is to monitor a handful of streets.  This was counter-intuitive to law enforcement beliefs at the time, where the adage was to cover as much of the city as possible.  Kansas City found great success in deploying officers in problematic blocks.  Kansas City ran more experiments, in which they started frisking people as long as they were given a reasonable cause.  Gladwell points out while this might be a difficult argument for pededstrians, there are a myrid of excuses for an officer to pull someone over while they are driving.  The latter experiments are also successful.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the book, Gladwell returns to Sandra Bland’s story.  Sandra Bland is pulled over while attempting to get out of the speeding officer’s way.  While understandably annoyed (who wouldn’t be?), Sandra is a recent transplant to Texas, trying to start fresh at life.  She has had negative encounters in the past with police officers, and is bogged down in fine due to minor infractions.  Gladwell points out how the legacy of Kansas City’s policing strategies has played out - an officer, does not default to truth, and is overly suspicious of someone he’s not familiar with, in a peaceful neighbourhood, pulled over for a filmsy excuse.  She was rightfully frustrated, and the officer chooses to escalate the situation assuming her irritation also means she’s a criminal.  After her arrest, Sandra Bland, depressed, having lost a child and godmother recently, with a record of attempted suicide, is not placed on suicide watch.  She takes her life.</p>
