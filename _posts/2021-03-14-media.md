# Book: The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis
---

I've been a big fan of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work, after reading [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html).  This book is refreshing as it explores their friendship and collaboration.  Michael Lewis starts the story with Kahneman's childhood - an intelligent Jewish boy and his family hid and flee from the Nazis.  Never staying in one European town for too long, living under precarious situations.  Kahneman was taught not to stick out too much and quietly observed others.  Kahneman sought out the motivations behind people's decisions, which led him to Hebrew University where the two would eventually meet.  Tversky on the other hand, was Israeli-born and whose childhood was relatively carefree.  Kahneman was constantly anxious, and self-doubting, albeit people sought him out for his brilliance in the field of decision making.  Tversky in contrast was a mathematical psychologist who was charming, optimistic, full of energy and confidnece.  Tversky and Kahneman were unlike in many ways, yet they complimented each other so well.  As Kahneman puts it - "Collaboration is not only more creative, it is more fun. [We] were better together than on our own. [..]  it was extremely pleasant not trying to work everything out yourself."  Upon reading this book, I was envious of how these soulmates found each other.  At the heart of it, this book was a love story between two friends who lifted each other up.  They could intellectually spar, never too attached to one's position, and creatively destroy and reconstrcut theories about human behaviour.  As their careers progress, they are lured away from Israel where distance strains their relationship.  In typical fashion, Americans overvalued Tversky's confidence and devalued Kahneman's contributions.  This caused a rift in their collaboration as its ease painfully fades away.  When Tversky finds that he is ill, they rekindle their friendship.  Tversky passes away, and Kahneman is awarded the Nobel Prize for their work together.  Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.

> My colleagues, they study artificial intelligence; me, I study natural stupidity. - Amos Tversky


# Book: White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo
---

Why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism.  White Fragility is written by a white ally who has dedicated her career to diversity and inclusion.  I imagine that the book was incredibly therpeutic as DiAngelo shares countless stories of the shit people say and do around her.  The people in these stories are hysterically unaware of their own behaviour.  Colourblindness or "I just don't see colour" downplays the lived experiences of people of colour.  In order to accept there is a problem, we must acknowledge the role that race plays in our lives.  There are still many that believe that because the USA elected a black president, that slavery and lynching is illegal, that racism has been "solved".  Yet the system of oppression that white folks historically, and still benefit from, is still alive and well.  Younger generations are not more "woke" or less racist, we are re-inventing new ways to express it.  From "Law and Order" to "All Lives Matter", we're reinventing new ways of oppression.  Even well intentioned people can perpetuate racism and reinforce stereotypes.  Allies are not infallible.  My takeaway from the book is that racism has gotten thickly subtle.  DiAngelo encourages white folks to examine their privilege, and be more open to feedback.  It is hard to imagine any book on race be free from criticism.  DiAngelo at times is incredibly (and refreshingly) direct.  The book can seem angry and confrontational at times.  Amy Landon, the narrator sounds like a robot.  My only wish for the book is for it to inspire rather than solely shame its readers!  While I appreciate someone doing the hard work of calling out people's bullshit, I cannot help but think that the book ruminates rather than promote folks to come closer together to work through these deep societal issues.  
White fragility comes out as anger, denial, guilt, avoidance, tears.  My takeaway it's easier to feel good about one's wokeness than to change their own behaviours.  It is hard to blame the human psyche from protecting itself/ego.  Still, it is wortwhile to get away from the moral and ethical attachments we have to being "good" and "bad -- we are both, at all times.

When white people avoid conversations about race, they , or accepting their own flaws as admitting to them will imply they are bad people.

White collective.

# Documentary: 13th by Ava DuVernay
---

This documentary is one of the best I've seen in a while.  The re-invention of racism is the main narrative of this documentary.  The pacing of documentary is fast, and is intellectually arousing the entire time.  The documentary starts slightly after the abolition of slavery in America.  Newly freed slaves are arrested on the grounds of homelessness.  Slavery evolves into Jim Crow where racial segregation was lawful.  Again, black people's freedoms are taken away, this time on account of breaking newly invented laws.  In the meantime, The Birth of a Nation and plethora of media portrays black people as people to be feared.  Black male comedians crossdressing to appear less threatening.  Law and order as euphemism to hurting black communities.  As the decades march on, we see the rise of the prison industrial complex.  Bill Clinton and Newt Gringrich both express remorse for the damage the laws they've passed have harmed the black community.  Sobering reminder that it is not only intent, but also impact.

> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist. - The 13th Amendment

# Book: Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari
---

A brief history of tomorrow.  Harari draws on his learnings from the past, and projects where we're going from where we are today. Given that humankind has largely eradicated some of its largest threats (famine, certain diseases), we set sight into the future.  Homo Deus explores humankind's next largest challenges - immortality, happiness, and giving ourselves superpowers.  The book is a bit dystopian in nature, as it predicts the downfall of humanism, as it gives rise to dataism.  Dataism postulates that information flow is the supreme value, and that any intervention to limit the flow of data is a violation of fundamental rights.  We are already living in an age and world where algorithms rule over our lives.  Transhumans might one day keep current-day humans as pets.  Beyond the futuristic predictions, I found the book repeats many of the themes found in the author's last book (Sapiens).

# Book: Shoe Dog by Phil Knight
---

Phil Knight loved running track.  While studying for his MBA, he had a hypothesis that he could sell high-end, low-cost running Onitsuka shoes from Japan.  After his graduation, he packed up his bags to travel the world - along the way, he makes a stop in Japan.  He convinces Tiger, the manufacturer to send him a small shipment of shoes.  Knight's father was a lawyer whose main goal in life was to amass respect.  Phil Knight on the other hand was way more interested in pursuing his dreams of being an entrepreneur.  With some convincing from his mother, his father reluctantly lends him the money he needed to start Blue Ribbon Sports.

Knight's coach was Bill Bowerman, who was a legend of his own.  Bowerman was also obsessed with shoes, he knew that high quality - low weight, durable, supportive shoes could make all the difference in a runner's time.  Knight convinces Bowerman to become his business partner, with Knight controlling 51/49 stake.  The story of Nike could be summarized as an escalating series of borrowing money, and re-investing it all back into growth.  In between, there were rivals that wanted a monopoly on distribution, learning to do business cross-culturally, unhelpful bankers, and assembling a ragtag crew.  At a certain tipping point, Knight cut ties with Tiger, forging his own destiny as a manufacturer, while keeping his Japanese investors happy.

The story ends with Nike's IPO, which happened to be on the same day as megacorp - Apple Inc.  Knight defends the criticisms of the conditions of the factories that manufactures his goods - citing he left the places better than before he arrived.  In the backdrop of Knight's career, he mentions the two boys he neglected growing up.  He references Nike as his third child.  At the end of the book, it sounds like he grieves his son, Matthew who died early in a diving accident.  Interestingly enough, he has a daughter that he does not mention at all in the book.

> I'd tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don't know what that means, seek it. - Phil Knight 

# Film: Fantastic Fungi
---

This film is centered around Paul Stamets, a mycologist, and his work with mushrooms.  In the forest, fungi play a vital role in breaking down dead foliage and converting them back into healthy, fertile soil.  Lesser known is fungi's ability to clean up oil spills, fight cancer, and as a natural pesticides.  If you don't have 80 minutes to watch the film, this 20 minute TED talk is more than enough.

# Book: How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan
---

_What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence_

Life changing and mystical are the words used frequently by people to describe their first psychadelic trip.  Psychadelics have played an important role in the spirital exploration of various cultures throughout human history.  It's one of the ways we can alter our consciousness in which people feel their ego and identity melt away, feel the weight of their mortality, face their greatest fears amongst many other out of their body experiences.

The author's own psychonautic exploration is intertwined with the history behind psychadelics.  LSD was discovered out of chance from the labatory of Albert Hofmann.  Hofmann's experience was the first, and only untainted account of being on a LSD trip.  The author argues that much of the language used to speak of psychadelic trips is heavily influenced by authors like Aldoux Huxley.  Timothy Leary was a prominent psychadelic researcher, later disgraced; and became a prominent face of coutnerculture and rebellion.  Psychadelic research's biggest challenge is quantifying an experience that can only be felt by the test subject.  The author argues its impossible for a researcher to understand what their subjects might be experiencing, without having tried psychaelics themselves.  A common experience for those that have been on psychadelic trips is unpacking one's mortality, and accepting that we will all one day depart from our bodies and this Earth.  The book also explores psychadelics potential to provide relief to those who suffer from addictions, anxiety, schizophrenia and other mental disorders.  Psychadelics deactivate the brain's default mode network, which grants the opportunity to see things from an entirely different perspective.  Dissolving the ego involves challenging the brain to break free from its regular patterns, and reach for more creative answers.  Less constraint from all the shortcuts that allow us to become the efficient problem solving machines adults normally are.

# Documentary: Crip Camp by James Lebrecht, Nicole Newnham
---

Crip Camp follow the lives of a core group of teenagers that meet at Camp Jened.  Many of these teenagers lived their lives as outsiders due to their disabilities.  As adults, they find themselves fighting for equality.  From protesting on the streets to staging a sit-in, they pushed laws forward that prevented segregation and increased accessibility for those with physical disabilities.

# Documentary: Disclosure by Sam Feder
---

Disclosure examines the narratives that are found in film and television, and unpacks how trans-folx are protrayed under a contemporary lens. We are taught that trans people are preverse and to be feared.  Men dressed as women should be laughed at.  One should vomit upon discovering the shameful secret of a transperson's past.  The documentary features a large cast of trans-folx, whom share their experiences and the impact these narratives have on their identities.  The one personal story that touched me most deeply was when one of the womxn admitted she couldn't see her own worth.  She came to this realization after seeing a young person disclose their gender identity, only to be accepted and supported by their family.  In contrast, her family constantly tried to deny her existence.

# Film: Farewell by Lulu Wang
---

An Asian-American film that explores the cultural differences around terminal illness.  The protagonist, Billi's family keeps her grandmother, Nai Nai's prognosis a secret from her grandmother.  As an Asian-American, she does not understand why.  Billi's extended family stages a fake wedding as an excuse to re-unite.  Her mother tries to explain that, "When people get cancer, they die. It's not the cancer that kills them; it's the fear."  I adored the soundtrack for this film.  While the characters keep up appearances around Nai Nai, the soundtrack ominously expresses the emotional burden that torment the family members.  Despite the sadness, there are light comedic moments that provide the audience moments of relief.  One of my favourite scenes involves Billi hammering away on the piano.

# Film: Nomadland by Chloé Zha
---

Nomadland follows a woman Fern, whose community has turned into a ghosttown after the industry that employed most folks shut down.  Fern stashes away her belongings, and uses the last of her savings to buy a campervan.  After her seasonal job at Amazon ends, she tries to find another job, however she eventually heads South for the winter in order to stay warm.  She meets a community of vandwellers that meet annually in the dessert.  The film features real people that have both voluntarily and involuntarily left the conventional lifestyle of a house and white picketfence.  One woman shares how she felt her life had been fulfilled from the yaers of experiencing the freedom of the road, and connecting with nature.  Another woman gives away her Earthly posessions when she finds out she has only months to live.  Fern meets a man who eventually gives up vandwelling to spend more time with his son and grandchildren.  Throughout the movie, we watch Fern struggle financially.  We eventually meet Fern's sister, who invites her to live with her, however Fern values her independence more than comforts and declines.

In February 2020, in the month before the world shutdown to combat the global pandemic; I spent two weeks living in a van.  This was never part of my life's plan.  I just pedalled my way around the island of Taiwan, and my partner called me during my transit in Singapore.  She was in the Brazilian rainforest and had met some travellers who were looking for people to deliver their campervan from Lisbon to Malaga.  We obliged, and 48 hours later we woke up along the Algarve coast.  We were not on any tight deadlines, and when we arrived in Malaga; my partner took off again to rendezvous with her family for a cruise trip.  I found myself living alone in a van for a week.  The van was pretty intimidating to manage all by myself.  Without a navigator, I mostly used it as a home base; albeit I had at least one adventure that triggered a large quantity of cortisol in my veins.  I felt very self-conscious, yet liberated at the same time.  It's interesting to see what stigma there is around certain lifestyles.  The voices in my head judged myself as a homeless, useless, unemployed, dirty bum and loser.

# Book: Talking To Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell
---
From the first time I spotted "The Tipping Point" at a bookstore, I was hooked.  Malcolm Gladwell has an art for weaving stories and analyses of social phenomenon.  His latest book, Talking to Strangers was a fun binge.  On the other hand, this book covers some heavy material.

The book central ideas are: truth-default theory, transparency, and coupling.  Humans are likely to default-to-truth, unless given sufficient evidence otherwise. Transparency is the idea that the way a stranger looks and acts is a reliable clue to the way they feel.  Our behaviours are more coupled to our environment, more than we like to admit.

The book starts with a story involving Sandra Bland, who has an encounter with a police officer. The officer ends up arresting her for failing to signal, and Sandra hangs herself in her jail cell a few days later.

## Truth Default Theory

Before we dive deeper into Sandra's story, Gladwell segues into stories between adversaries.  In the first story, we explore the first encounter between Cortés and Montezuma.  Mistaking Montezuma's humility for a literal admission of weakness, Cortez conquers the Aztecs.  During WWII, Neville Chamberlain is confident he can de-escalate the tensions with Germany.  Adolf Hitler convinces Chamberlain that Germany has no ambitions beyond a few disputed territories.  History remembers Chamberlain as a fool who trusted a war-monger.  In both of these encounters, one party failed to judge the true intent of their adversaries.  Gladwell argues that Chamberlain was better off  reading Mein Kampf than meeting Hitler.

How susceptible are human judges from deception?  Gladwell a machine learning algorithm that resulted in better parole hearing outcomes[^1].  Given the incentive to mislead or deceive, exposure to more information is harmful.  This reminds me of the story of Michael LaPaglia[^2] (not in the book).  Gladwell tells the story of Ana Montes, one of the most damaging spies in American history. Ana Montes leaked secrets to the Cubans for 15 years leaking secrets.  Counter-intelligence agents investigated her, yet found her not guilty.  Ana's stellar reputation, benign excuses, let her escape from arrest for many years.

When we default-to-truth, we sometimes overlook mounting evidence.  Jerry Sandusky was a well-respected football coach, and a generous and charitable person.  One night, a witness caught Jerry sexually abusing a young boy.  Almost a decade past before Jerry was arrested.  Many of his victims looked up to him as a father figure, and their testimonies buried under layers of trauma.  Gladwell points out that many people assume there's a larger conspiracy at play.  School administration trying to cover up for him, or for some monetary gain.  Humans tend to want to believe the best in people.  Especially when those people tell you their version of the truth.

In contrast, Gladwell writes about Larry Nassar, another sexual predator.  Nassar sexually abused women, sometimes in front of their parents. His cover-up story is that it was part of his medical procedures. A decade and hundreds of victims later, enough evidence mounted to prosecute him.  In this case, the people involved in "covering up" are the parents of the victims.  There's no way that these parents would want such a terrible thing for their children.  Again, humans tend to want to believe the best in people.  Who could fathom such atrocities were happening to their own children?

As far as Ponzi scheme goes, Bernie Madoff holds the record for the largest at tens of billions of American dollars. Gladwell's focus on the events is less about Madoff, but more about Harry Markopolos. Markopolos is a whistleblower whom is suspect of everyone. Gladwell follows Markopolos' attempts to rally support, but was repeatedly ignored. Audio excerpts easily paints an image of Markopolos as the caricature of a man wearing a tinfoil hat. Markpolos had a reputation for distrusting everyone.  The lesson here is that the basis of our society relies on good faith and trust.  Without this, human co-operation is not [^3]. If we all acted like Markopolos, we may avoid all risks, yet limit our potential as well.

## Transparency

Academic laboratories study facial gestures to encode and decode people's feelings.  How accurate is this?  Characters on TV/Film convey their emotions in dramatized way to the audience.  Real life does not work this way, yet we often assume we can read people's intentions based on their body language.

Amanda Knox is the young American woman accused of murdering her Italian roommate.  Living amongst a foreign country, she was misunderstood.  She did not seem remorseful enough.  She was goofy-natured.  How she acted did not fit a  preconceive mold of how one should deal with grief.  Prosecutors and police officers alike misjudge her character.  She spent 4 years in jail before acquittal.

KSM was one of the world's most wanted terrorists.  The FBI locked him up and tortured him for many years.  Turns out chronic torture will fuck up your brain and memories.  Today, KSM is one of the most notorious terrorists out there, yet many doubt his testimonies.  When someone has nothing to lose, and only reputation to gain, why not lie?

Brock Turner raped Chanel Miller while she was unconscious.  They met at a frat party.  Gladwell argues that talking to strangers is hard enough - Mixing courtship, heavy binge drinking rituals, and unstructured social norms?  Absolute disaster.  A  side effect to feminism is that women have become heavier drinkers.  Under the influence, people's memories can be misleading and blackout altogether.  At the same time, people demonstrate the ability to carry out somewhat complex tasks.  Gladwell agrees that consent and respect are crucial.  However, how effective are these methods in the absence of sobriety?

## Coupling

Sylvia Plath took her own life via carbon monoxide poisoning, by sticking her head into an oven. This was only possible during the "town gas years" before the push for natural gas.  Carbon monoxide  had higher suicide rates compared to the baseline during those years.  A popular misconception claims suicidal people will take their lives under any circumstance.  The mechanism chosen to take one's life is significant when committing to go through with it.  Sylvia Plath's suicide is coupled to the accessibility of carbon-monoxide.

This brings us to the raising crime in America. In Boston, a criminologist notices that a crime is concentrated amongst a few city blocks. This analysis is carried out throughout America and the world, and holds true. Therefore, crime and location are coupled.  The conclusion is that the most effective method of patrol, is to monitor a handful of streets. This was counter-intuitive to law enforcement beliefs at the time.  The adage at the time is to spray patrol across as much of the city as possible.  Kansas City found great success in deploying officers in problematic intersections. Kansas City ran an experiment to frisk people under a reasonable cause.  There are a myriad of excuses for an officer to pull someone over while they are driving.

## End

We finally return to Sandra Bland's story.  Sandra Bland is trying to pull over to get out of the way of the officer's speeding vehicle.  The officer pulls her over for failing to signal.  As a recent recent transplant to Texas, Sandra is also trying to get a fresh start.  Sandra has negative encounters in the past with police officers.  A common experience amongst black Americans.  Sandra is also in debt, from minor traffic infractions in her past life in Illinois.  This is how the intersecting social phenomenal play out.  Empowered by Kansas City's experiment, the officer to pull Sandra over for a flimsy excuse.  The officer does not default to truth.  He is suspicious of people he's not familiar with in a peaceful neighbourhood, as trained.  Sandra was rightfully frustrated, and the officer chooses to escalate the situation.  He assumes her irritation means she's someone not cooperative.  Sandra is arrested.  Despite having lost a child and godmother recently, with a record of attempted suicide, is not placed on suicide watch. She takes her life.
