[![The Most Astounding Fact](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9D05ej8u-gU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D05ej8u-gU "The Most Astounding Fact")

The most astounding fact... is the knowledge, that the atoms that compromise life on Earth, the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucible, that cooked light elements into heavy elements, in their core, under extreme temperatures and pressure.  These stars, the high mass ones among them, went unstable in their later years; they collapsed and exploded, scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy.  Guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen; and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself.  These ingredients become gas clouds, that condense, collapse and form the next generation of solar systems.  Stars with orbiting planets - and those planets now have ingredients for life itself.  So when I look up at the night sky, and I know that yes, we are, part of this universe; we are in this universe.  But perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up and many people feel small cause they're small and the universe is big.  But I feel big, because my atoms came from those stars.  There's a level of connectivity - that's what you really want in life; you want to feel connected, want to feel relevant, want to feel like you're a participant in the goings on of activities and events around you.  That's precisely what we are, just by being alive.
