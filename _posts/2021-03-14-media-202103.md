# Book: The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis
---

I've been a big fan of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work, after reading [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html).  This book is refreshing as it explores their friendship and collaboration.

Michael Lewis begins the story with Kahneman's childhood - an intelligent Jewish boy and his family hid and flee from the Nazis.  Never staying in one European town for too long, living under precarious situations.  Kahneman learnt to stay in the background as much as possible.  This gave him ample opportunities to observe those around him.  Kahneman sought to understand the motivations behind people's decisions.  This led him to Hebrew University where the two would eventually meet.

> Collaboration is not only more creative, it is more fun. [We] were better together than on our own. [..] it was extremely pleasant not trying to work everything out yourself.  - Daniel Kahneman

Tversky was Israeli-born and whose childhood was relatively carefree.  As a mathematical psychologist, he prefer quantifying the human condition.  Tversky was charming, optimistic, full of energy and confidence.  In contrast, his eventual partner in crime was anxious, full of self-doubt and.  Tversky and Kahneman were unlike in many ways, yet they complimented each other so well.

> My colleagues, they study artificial intelligence; me, I study natural stupidity. - Amos Tversky

Upon reading this book, I was envious of how these soulmates found each other. At the heart of it, this book was a love story between two friends who lifted each other up. They could spar intellectually, never too attached to one's position.  They destroy and reconstructed their theories about human behaviour in a creative manner.  As their careers progress, they move away from Israel.  The distance starts to put a strain on their relationship.  In typical fashion, Americans overvalued Tversky's confidence and devalued Kahneman's contributions.  This deepened the rift in their conflict.  Their relationship deteriorates and they find themselves unable to collaborate with one another.  When Tversky finds that he is ill, they rekindle their friendship.  Tversky passes away, and Kahneman wins the Nobel Prize for their work together. Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.

# Book: White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo
---

_Why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism._  DiAngelo, the author, is a white ally who has dedicated her career to diversity and inclusion.  She shares countless stories of the shit people say and do around her.  Some of the people in these stories are unaware of their own behaviour.

Colourblindness or "I just don't see colour" downplays the lived experiences of people of colour.  To accept there is a problem, we must acknowledge the role that race plays in our lives.  Some folk believe that racism has been "solved".  The USA elected a black president, that slavery and lynching is illegal!  The system of oppression that white folks still benefit from, is still alive and well.

Younger generations are not more any less racist.  We keep re-inventing new ways to express our biases.  From "Law and Order" to "All Lives Matter", we're also reinventing new ways of oppression. Racism has gotten thickly subtle. Even well intentioned people can perpetuate racism and reinforce stereotypes. Allies are not infallible. White fragility kicks in when people's problematic behaviour is call-out.  There might be anger, denial, guilt, avoidance, or tears.  It's easier to feel good about one's wokeness than to change one's behaviour. It is hard to blame the human psyche from protecting itself/ego. Still, it is worthwhile to get away from the moral and ethical attachments we have to being "good" and "bad"  DiAngelo encourages white folks to examine their privilege, and hold space for others.

It is hard to imagine any book on race be free from criticism.  The book can seem angry and confrontational at times.  It's vulnerable and hard work calling out people's bullshit.  I worry that the book seeks to shame its readers.  Instead, I hope folks come closer together to work through these deep societal issues.  Amy Landon, the narrator sounds like a robot.


# Documentary: 13th by Ava DuVernay
---

This documentary is one of the best I've seen in a while. The re-invention of racism is the main narrative of this documentary. The pacing of documentary is fast, and is intellectually arousing the entire time. The documentary begins after the abolition of slavery in America.  The state arrest recently freed slaves on the grounds of homelessness.  Slavery evolves into Jim Crow where racial segregation is lawful. Black people's freedoms are taken away, this time on account of breaking these new laws. In the meantime, The Birth of a Nation and plethora of media portrays black people as people to be feared. Black male comedians crossdress to appear less threatening. Law and order becomes a euphemism for hurting black communities. As the decades march on, we see the rise of the prison industrial complex. Bill Clinton and Newt Gringrich both express remorse for the laws they backed.  These laws disproportionately harmed black communities. Sobering reminder that it is not only intent, but also impact.

> Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist. - The 13th Amendment

# Book: Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari
---

_A brief history of tomorrow._  Harari draws on his learnings from the past, and projects where we're going from where we are today. Given that humankind has largely eradicated some of its largest threats (famine, certain diseases), we set sight into the future.  Homo Deus explores humankind's next largest challenges - immortality, happiness, and giving ourselves superpowers.  The book is a bit dystopian in nature, as it predicts the downfall of humanism, as it gives rise to dataism.  Dataism postulates that information flow is the supreme value, and that any intervention to limit the flow of data is a violation of fundamental rights.  We are already living in an age and world where algorithms rule over our lives.  Transhumans might one day keep current-day humans as pets.  Beyond the futuristic predictions, I found the book repeats many of the themes found in the author's last book (Sapiens).

# Book: Shoe Dog by Phil Knight
---

Phil Knight loved running track. While studying for his MBA, he had a hypothesis that he could sell high-end, low-cost running Onitsuka shoes from Japan. After his graduation, he packed up his bags to travel the world - along the way, he makes a stop in Japan. He convinces Tiger, the manufacturer to send him a small shipment of shoes. Knight's father was a lawyer whose main goal in life was to amass respect. Phil Knight was way more interested in pursuing his dreams of being an entrepreneur.  His mother convinces his father to lend him $50.  This was the beginning of Blue Ribbon Sports.

> I'd tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don't know what that means, seek it. - Phil Knight 

Knight's coach was Bill Bowerman, who was a legend of his own. Bowerman was also obsessed with shoes.  He knew that high quality - low weight, durable, supportive shoes could make all the difference in a runner's time. Knight convinces Bowerman to become his business partner.  Knight takes a controlling 51/49 stake.

Nike's story can be summarized by an escalating series of borrowing money, and re-investing it all back into growth.  Along the way, there were rivals that wanted a monopoly on distribution.  Learning to do business cross-culturally was crucial in this story of globalization.  Bankers being generally risk-adverse and unhelpful. A ragtag crew that were corporate misfits determined to help Nike succeed.  Nike hits a tipping point, where Tiger became the bottleneck for growth.  Nike starts their own product lines, forging Nike's destiny as a manufacturer.

The story ends with Nike's IPO, which happened to be on the same day as megacorp - Apple Inc. Knight defends the working conditions conditions of the factories that manufactures Nike's goods.  He cites that Nike always left the places better than before they arrived. In the backdrop of Knight's career, he mentions the two boys he neglected growing up. He references Nike as his third child.  At the end of the book, he grieves his son, Matthew who died early in a diving accident.  Interestingly enough, he has a daughter that he does not mention at all in the book.

This film is centered around Paul Stamets, a mycologist, and his work with mushrooms.  In the forest, fungi play a vital role in breaking down dead foliage and converting them back into healthy, fertile soil.  Lesser known is fungi's ability to clean up oil spills, fight cancer, and as a natural pesticides.  If you don't have 80 minutes to watch the film, this 20 minute TED talk is more than enough.

# Book: How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan

_What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence_

Life changing and mystical are the words used by people to describe psychedelics. Psychedelics have facilitated the spiritual exploration of various cultures throughout human history. It's one of the ways we can alter our consciousness.  It grants the experience of watching one's ego and identity melt away.  Many feel the weight of their mortality, and face their greatest fears.  This book intertwines the history of psychedelics with the author's psychonautic experience. 

LSD was discovered out of chance from the laboratory of Albert Hofmann. Hofmann's experience was the first, and only untainted account of being on a LSD trip. Much of the language used to describe psychedelic trips is heavily influenced by authors like Aldoux Huxley. Timothy Leary was a prominent psychedelic researcher.  His unconventional research methods invited heavy criticism from allies and critics alike.  He became a prominent face of counterculture and rebellion.

To make sense of a psychedelic trip, one must have experienced it themselves.  The human experience is hard to quantify, but especially so when that experience is "out of this world".  Psychedelics has the potential to provide therapeutic relief for many many mental disorders.  Psychedelics deactivate the brain's default mode network.  This grants the opportunity to see things from a different perspective.  This brief change can have long lasting effects.  Addicts find themselves rehabilitated.  The anxious can find calm.  Dissolving the ego challenges the brain to break free from its regular patterns. Our brains are efficient problem solving machines.  Psychedelics force our brains to reach for more creative answers.

# Documentary: Crip Camp by James Lebrecht, Nicole Newnham
---

Crip Camp follow the lives of a core group of teenagers that meet at Camp Jened.  Many of these teenagers lived their lives as outsiders due to their disabilities.  As adults, they find themselves fighting for equality.  From protesting on the streets to staging a sit-in, they pushed laws forward that prevented segregation and increased accessibility for those with physical disabilities.

# Documentary: Disclosure by Sam Feder
---

Disclosure examines the narratives found in film and television under a contemporary lens. It features a large cast of trans-folx. Each share share their experiences and the impact the media has had on their identities.

Trans-folx are often portrayed as perverse and sociopathic. Men dressed as women should be laughed at. One should vomit upon discovering the shameful secret of a transperson’s past.  They are inevitably the murder victims.

This quote from Jen Richards stuck with me.

> I had to be okay with my mom saying, "I will never call you Jen because Jen murdered my son." I had to- I had to be okay with that in order to survive myself, you know? In order to deal with not being able to see my grandma before she died because I could only come home if I dressed as a boy. You know. I had to deal with the fact that one of my best friends, who, like, I stood up at his wedding, won't let me meet his children. I have to deal with those things. Like, I have to live with those things. And I have to make that okay. I have to understand their position and be okay with it.

> [After witnessing a young person be accepted for their gender identity]
>
>  And when I saw that father go so much further than I thought was even possible, it hurt, I couldn't bear it, because then, all of a sudden, all those people who couldn't accept me... When I knew it was possible to go beyond acceptance... Why couldn't my mom have been like him? That's the question I never asked until that moment. Why couldn't my mom have been like him? Why couldn't my friends have been like him and seen the value in my experience? But the person who's most responsible for failing to have that kind of vision is me. I have never seen myself the way that father saw his own child. I'd never seen myself that way, I'd never looked at myself with the kind of love and respect and awe that that father had for his own child. No one's looked at me that way, how could I look at me that way? I had to see it. And now that I have, I want that.

# Film: Farewell by Lulu Wang
---

An Asian-American film that explores the cultural differences around terminal illness.  The protagonist, Billi's family keeps her grandmother, Nai Nai's prognosis a secret from her grandmother.  As an Asian-American, she does not understand why.  Billi's extended family stages a fake wedding as an excuse to re-unite.  Her mother tries to explain that, "When people get cancer, they die. It's not the cancer that kills them; it's the fear."  I adored the soundtrack for this film.  While the characters keep up appearances around Nai Nai, the soundtrack ominously expresses the emotional burden that torment the family members.  Despite the sadness, there are light comedic moments that provide the audience moments of relief.  One of my favourite scenes involves Billi hammering away on the piano.

# Film: Nomadland by Chloé Zha
---

After the gypsum plant closes down, Empire NV turns into a ghost town.  Fern stashes away her belongings, and uses the last of her savings to buy a campervan.  She's unable to find another job after her seasonal job at an Amazon warehouse ends.  Fern learns about a community of van-dwellers and heads South for the winter.  The film features real people in this community.  Some involuntarily adopt this lifestyle, while others prefer van-dwelling over the conventional lifestyle.  One woman shares the moment she felt entirely fulfilled after years of freedom on the road and connecting with nature. Another woman gives away her Earthly posessions when she finds out she has only months to live. Fern meets a man who eventually gives up van-dwelling to spend more time with his son and grandchildren.  Throughout the movie, we watch Fern struggle financially. We eventually meet Fern's sister, who invites her to live with her, yet Fern values her independence more than comforts and declines.

In February 2020, in the month before the world shutdown to combat the global pandemic; I spent two weeks living in a van.  This was never part of my life's plan.  I just pedalled my way around the island of Taiwan, and my partner called me during my transit in Singapore.  She was in the Brazilian rainforest and had met some travellers who were looking for people to deliver their campervan from Lisbon to Malaga.  We obliged, and 48 hours later we woke up along the Algarve coast.  We were not on any tight deadlines, and when we arrived in Malaga; my partner took off again to rendezvous with her family for a cruise trip.  I found myself living alone in a van for a week.  The van was pretty intimidating to manage all by myself.  Without a navigator, I mostly used it as a home base; albeit I had at least one adventure that triggered a large quantity of cortisol in my veins.  I felt very self-conscious, yet liberated at the same time.  It's interesting to see what stigma there is around certain lifestyles.  The voices in my head judged myself as a homeless, useless, unemployed, dirty bum and loser.

# Book: Talking To Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell
---
From the first time I spotted "The Tipping Point" at a bookstore, I was hooked.  Malcolm Gladwell has an art for weaving stories and analyses of social phenomenon.  His latest book, Talking to Strangers was a fun binge.  On the other hand, this book covers some heavy material.

The book central ideas are: truth-default theory, transparency, and coupling.  Humans are likely to default-to-truth, unless given sufficient evidence otherwise. Transparency is the idea that the way a stranger looks and acts is a reliable clue to the way they feel.  Our behaviours are more coupled to our environment, more than we like to admit.

The book starts with a story involving Sandra Bland, who has an encounter with a police officer. The officer ends up arresting her for failing to signal, and Sandra hangs herself in her jail cell a few days later.

## Truth Default Theory

Before we dive deeper into Sandra's story, Gladwell segues into stories between adversaries.  In the first story, we explore the first encounter between Cortés and Montezuma.  Mistaking Montezuma's humility for a literal admission of weakness, Cortez conquers the Aztecs.  During WWII, Neville Chamberlain is confident he can de-escalate the tensions with Germany.  Adolf Hitler convinces Chamberlain that Germany has no ambitions beyond a few disputed territories.  History remembers Chamberlain as a fool who trusted a war-monger.  In both of these encounters, one party failed to judge the true intent of their adversaries.  Gladwell argues that Chamberlain was better off  reading Mein Kampf than meeting Hitler.

How susceptible are human judges from deception?  Gladwell a machine learning algorithm that resulted in better parole hearing outcomes[^1].  Given the incentive to mislead or deceive, exposure to more information is harmful.  This reminds me of the story of Michael LaPaglia[^2] (not in the book).  Gladwell tells the story of Ana Montes, one of the most damaging spies in American history. Ana Montes leaked secrets to the Cubans for 15 years leaking secrets.  Counter-intelligence agents investigated her, yet found her not guilty.  Ana's stellar reputation, benign excuses, let her escape from arrest for many years.

When we default-to-truth, we sometimes overlook mounting evidence.  Jerry Sandusky was a well-respected football coach, and a generous and charitable person.  One night, a witness caught Jerry sexually abusing a young boy.  Almost a decade past before Jerry was arrested.  Many of his victims looked up to him as a father figure, and their testimonies buried under layers of trauma.  Gladwell points out that many people assume there's a larger conspiracy at play.  School administration trying to cover up for him, or for some monetary gain.  Humans tend to want to believe the best in people.  Especially when those people tell you their version of the truth.

In contrast, Gladwell writes about Larry Nassar, another sexual predator.  Nassar sexually abused women, sometimes in front of their parents. His cover-up story is that it was part of his medical procedures. A decade and hundreds of victims later, enough evidence mounted to prosecute him.  In this case, the people involved in "covering up" are the parents of the victims.  There's no way that these parents would want such a terrible thing for their children.  Again, humans tend to want to believe the best in people.  Who could fathom such atrocities were happening to their own children?

As far as Ponzi scheme goes, Bernie Madoff holds the record for the largest at tens of billions of American dollars. Gladwell's focus on the events is less about Madoff, but more about Harry Markopolos. Markopolos is a whistleblower whom is suspect of everyone. Gladwell follows Markopolos' attempts to rally support, but was repeatedly ignored. Audio excerpts easily paints an image of Markopolos as the caricature of a man wearing a tinfoil hat. Markpolos had a reputation for distrusting everyone.  The lesson here is that the basis of our society relies on good faith and trust.  Without this, human co-operation is not [^3]. If we all acted like Markopolos, we may avoid all risks, yet limit our potential as well.

## Transparency

Academic laboratories study facial gestures to encode and decode people's feelings.  How accurate is this?  Characters on TV/Film convey their emotions in dramatized way to the audience.  Real life does not work this way, yet we often assume we can read people's intentions based on their body language.

Amanda Knox is the young American woman accused of murdering her Italian roommate.  Living amongst a foreign country, she was misunderstood.  She did not seem remorseful enough.  She was goofy-natured.  How she acted did not fit a  preconceive mold of how one should deal with grief.  Prosecutors and police officers alike misjudge her character.  She spent 4 years in jail before acquittal.

KSM was one of the world's most wanted terrorists.  The FBI locked him up and tortured him for many years.  Turns out chronic torture will fuck up your brain and memories.  Today, KSM is one of the most notorious terrorists out there, yet many doubt his testimonies.  When someone has nothing to lose, and only reputation to gain, why not lie?

Brock Turner raped Chanel Miller while she was unconscious.  They met at a frat party.  Gladwell argues that talking to strangers is hard enough - Mixing courtship, heavy binge drinking rituals, and unstructured social norms?  Absolute disaster.  A  side effect to feminism is that women have become heavier drinkers.  Under the influence, people's memories can be misleading and blackout altogether.  At the same time, people demonstrate the ability to carry out somewhat complex tasks.  Gladwell agrees that consent and respect are crucial.  However, how effective are these methods in the absence of sobriety?

## Coupling

Sylvia Plath took her own life via carbon monoxide poisoning, by sticking her head into an oven. This was only possible during the "town gas years" before the push for natural gas.  Carbon monoxide  had higher suicide rates compared to the baseline during those years.  A popular misconception claims suicidal people will take their lives under any circumstance.  The mechanism chosen to take one's life is significant when committing to go through with it.  Sylvia Plath's suicide is coupled to the accessibility of carbon-monoxide.

This brings us to the raising crime in America. In Boston, a criminologist notices that a crime is concentrated amongst a few city blocks. This analysis is carried out throughout America and the world, and holds true. Therefore, crime and location are coupled.  The conclusion is that the most effective method of patrol, is to monitor a handful of streets. This was counter-intuitive to law enforcement beliefs at the time.  The adage at the time is to spray patrol across as much of the city as possible.  Kansas City found great success in deploying officers in problematic intersections. Kansas City ran an experiment to frisk people under a reasonable cause.  There are a myriad of excuses for an officer to pull someone over while they are driving.

## End

We finally return to Sandra Bland's story.  Sandra Bland is trying to pull over to get out of the way of the officer's speeding vehicle.  The officer pulls her over for failing to signal.  As a recent recent transplant to Texas, Sandra is also trying to get a fresh start.  Sandra has negative encounters in the past with police officers.  A common experience amongst black Americans.  Sandra is also in debt, from minor traffic infractions in her past life in Illinois.  This is how the intersecting social phenomenal play out.  Empowered by Kansas City's experiment, the officer to pull Sandra over for a flimsy excuse.  The officer does not default to truth.  He is suspicious of people he's not familiar with in a peaceful neighbourhood, as trained.  Sandra was rightfully frustrated, and the officer chooses to escalate the situation.  He assumes her irritation means she's someone not cooperative.  Sandra is arrested.  Despite having lost a child and godmother recently, with a record of attempted suicide, is not placed on suicide watch. She takes her life.
